# üñ•Ô∏è Ewaste to E-console: DIY External Console for Your Homelab

> **Note:** This page is currently a work in progress. Expect updates in the future. A [release] tag will be added when finalized.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Problem With Headless Servers

Modern-day servers, especially refurbished enterprise ones used by homelabbers, often lack an easy way to access them graphically. For example, my HP Proliant has an ILO, but there isn‚Äôt a good way to SSH into it without a monitor or a KVM console, which can be quite expensive. While cheaper options exist online, they‚Äôre still not budget-friendly.

So, what‚Äôs the solution? That‚Äôs exactly what I set out to find when I stumbled upon my dad‚Äôs old Optiplex 7460.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Turning Ewaste Into a Console

### The Hardware

  </a>
</p>

This is my dad's old Optiplex 7460, which I claimed when he shut down his lab at a hospital in Toronto. It features:

- **CPU:** Intel i7-8700  
- **RAM:** 8 GB DDR4 SODIMM  
- **Storage:** 256 GB NVMe SSD (with expansion slots for additional SATA SSDs and RAM)  

Despite its quirks (i.e, a streak of burnt-in purple pixels, a failing CMOS battery, and being incredible dusty) it still had plenty of compute power.

With a toothbrush, a can of air, and a replacement CMOS battery, I cleaned it up. Now, aside from the streak, it‚Äôs like new. Originally intended for slicing and prepping 3D models, I realized it could also serve as a low-power workstation/console for my homelab.

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 1: Install a Lightweight OS

I chose **Linux Mint** for its user-friendly interface, lightweight nature, and full feature set. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

1. **Download Linux Mint:** [Official Website](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)  
2. **Create a Bootable USB:** Use tools like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).  
3. **Install Linux Mint:** Follow the installation wizard.  
4. **Optimize the System:**  
   - Disable unnecessary services to save RAM.  
   - Update the system using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.  
   - Install any additional drivers if needed.
   - Consider uninstalling any pre-installed software you won't use, like office tools or business apps.

## üê≥ Step 2: Set Up Docker & Portainer

Docker and Portainer make managing containers a breeze. Here‚Äôs how to set them up:

1. **Install Docker:**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```
2. **Install Portainer:**  
   ```bash
   docker volume create portainer_data
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
   ```
3. **Access Portainer:** Open `http://<your-ip>:9000` in your browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Build Your Console Toolkit

Here‚Äôs a list of recommended Docker containers to transform your machine into a multifunctional homelab console:

| **Service**      | **Image**                      | **Purpose**                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Code-Server**  | `ghcr.io/coder/code-server`   | Web-based VSCode for scripting/admin     |
| **Shellhub**     | `shellhubio/ssh:latest`       | Remote SSH from anywhere                 |
| **Netdata**      | `netdata/netdata`             | Remote system data monitoring            |
| **File Browser** | `filebrowser/filebrowser`     | Access homelab files over the web        |

> **Bonus:** If you‚Äôre exploring niche setups, consider adding a PiKVM, JetKVM, or serial-over-USB. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt due to budget constraints.

## üîó Step 4: Connecting to Your Homelab

Here‚Äôs how you can use the E-console:

- **Physical Console:** Plug it into broken or offline servers as a screen/keyboard/mouse.  
- **Web-Based Tool:** Use it to SSH into any node.  
- **Monitoring Station:** Track uptime, load, and logs locally.  

> **Tip:** Consider creating a basic network diagram to visualize your setup.

## üåç Conclusion: Reduce Waste, Gain Tools

By repurposing an old device, you‚Äôve saved it from contaminating an environment while re-using it as a good terminal!
