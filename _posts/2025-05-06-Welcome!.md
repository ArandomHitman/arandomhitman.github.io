# 👋 Welcome to My Site!

Welcome to my first ever website!

This self-hosted Jekyll site is where I share my projects, ideas, and lessons (good and bad) learned. Whether it's a post about a new server, repairs, or experimenting with 3D printing, you'll find all my documentation here.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

I built this blog not just to show off my work, but to help others learn. Expect posts on:

- 🛠️ **Project Logs** — Walkthroughs, product links, and helpful advice for whatever I do.
- 💡 **Tutorials** — Hands-on guides for DIY, Linux, homelabbing, and other stuff.
- 🧠 **Lessons Learned** — Mistakes made, problems solved, and what I’d do differently if I had more time/money.
- 📦 **Product Reviews** — Reviews on various products I receive or buy.
- 🚀 **Progress Updates** — Education milestones, certifications, and professional development.

## 🙋 Why I'm Doing This

This blog isn’t just a website I threw out on the internet for fun; it's meant for me to share my knowledge with others. If one posts helps you out, i've succeeded in that.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out by email, Linkedin, Reddit, or more!

Thanks for stopping by.
