# 👋 Welcome to My Site!

Welcome! glad you clicked on my site!

This self-hosted Jekyll site is a space I’ve made to share my projects, ideas, and advice related to technology, hardware engineering, homelabbing, and anything else I do. Whether it's a server upgrade, a product review, or just me messing around, you'll find it all here.

## What to Expect

Here’s what you can expect to see whenever I post:
- 🛠️ **Project Logs** — Updates on what I’m building, fixing, and whatever else I do when bored.
- 💡 **Tutorials** — Tutorials on networking, hardware, software, and more.
- 🧠 **Lessons Learned** — Reflections on wins *and* failures.
- 📦 **Product Reviews** - Buying and/or receiving different products and reviewing them 
- 🚀 **Progress Updates** — Professional growth, educational milestones, and experimentation whenever.

I’m writing this blog not just for archival purposes, but for others benefits. If you find anything useful, confusing, or just want to chat, feel free to email me!

Stay tuned—there’s more to come when I get time!

\- Liam
